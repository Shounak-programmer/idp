# 🚑 Smart Traffic System: Ambulance Priority & Noise-Free Horn Communication

<div align="center">

**A real-time multi-application system that reduces ambulance delays on Indian roads by enabling automated signal preemption and hornless vehicle communication.**

*The system connects Drivers, Ambulances, and Traffic Authorities with instant synchronized alerts and live routing intelligence.*

## 🚦 Why This Project?

In India, **thousands of emergency patients lose their life** due to delayed ambulance arrival, largely caused by traffic mismanagement.

### This system aims to:

- 🚑 **Provide ambulances fastest possible routes**
- 🚥 **Automatically clear roads ahead**
- 🔇 **Remove toxic honking noise** using silent communication
- 🏛️ **Improve visibility for traffic authorities**

> ⏱️ **Every second counts — and our system is built to save them.**
